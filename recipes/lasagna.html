    <li><a>STEP 1:</a></li>
    <p>
    Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
    Stir in plant-based sausage, meat substitute crumbles, crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, water,
    1 tablespoon parsley, sugar, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Bring to a boil;
    reduce heat and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours.

    <li><a>STEP 2:</a></li>
    <p>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles; cook 8 to 10 minutes.
     Drain and rinse noodles with cold water.

    To assemble lasagna, spread 1/3 of the sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce.ù
    Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella slices. 
    Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over mozzarella and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.

    Bake, covered with cooking spray-coated foil, for 25 minutes.
